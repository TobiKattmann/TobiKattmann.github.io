As I didn't have time for breakfast today and made quick process of my prepared cereals for lunch I thought I could use the beautiful weather to pick some trash.
Starting with revisiting the some cleaned areas of last time (5 days ago) took me maybe 15 minutes. It is very reasonable that i oerlooked some things in the first sweep but the vast majority appeared in the meantime ... 
Cigarette butts are expected as they are mindlessly thrown away all the time, but larger plastic things is sth I thought would accumulate over a larger timeframe. 
Going on with just a small section beside a big road with a pedestrian crossing and a subway station was really frustrating. I barely moved as there so much little things. And a lot of cigarette buds. 
At some point I moved on to a side road as just picking up butts that people threw on the ground in front of the elevator to the subway is not cool. 
I thought about making before-after pictures but often you will not too much of a difference. The big pieces of trash (I once heard the term 'sext trash') will be picked up in these urban environments eventually ... at least I hope.
But the small pieces and edges that hide under the leaves or between the grass, visible only from near, or from the right angle (sunlight helps a lot here), are not seen in a picture.
I guess the best measure to count indivdual picks or time for that matter as I need as much time to pick up sth big as for a tiny plastic edge. 

I was not cool to leave the area half picked. Especially walking past trash on the way back is weird ... but I have to work sometime i guess

I just use a 25L plastic bag which is not ideal due to the wind and the wobbly opening. So next time I will prob use a can of some sort.
