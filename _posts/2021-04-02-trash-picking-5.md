0930-1030, ~2.0kg of weight

Good Friday. National holiday. I prefer work-free days like sundays and holidys to go out early (... not really early though) in the morning simply because very few people are around and it is really peaceful. Shorts and pullover weather plus nice sunshine plus the great Baywatch Berlin podcast made it a lot easier to go out today.

Starting with the usual area around the kindergarden and therefore picking up trash that magically got there since last sunday, I went on to expand my area to the side road between metro and housing. I think I now finished picking all the trash from the area at the metro's bike stand. That took a couple of times simply because hanging out in just one 20 sqm area for half an hour is not really fun. I wanna see the world!

This is something I saw a couple of times now and have no real clue what it is. My best guess it is to some degree part a something sweet to buy at lidl, maybe something with a toy and this is residual plastic?

I mean, if you throw your ticket to the ground then it is of course a nice touch to rip it multiple pieces before, such that it is harder to clean up.

This is the kind of stuff that makes a huge chunk of the weight and volume.

When I found this closed bike lock I first thought I could try to pick as a little hobby project, but that idea was quickly discarded because of  laziness. The area between the side road and metro track is a bit steep and a barrier hinders you going closer to the tracks which is a good thing in general. For now I only bent over to pick everything I could reach but I will hop over sometime in the future to do the rest. As there are no downtimes beyond in the middle of the night carefulness is important with metros passing by.

This made me a bit angry. I passed this point half an hour earlier with no trash lying around. Picking the same area week for week is kind of same but in a larger time-frame, but 30 min is really no cool.

On the way back I saw cat and I am not sure why exactly choosing this position but cat will have its reasons.

Cigarette butts are half of all trash-picks on the runs now because that is probably what is most thrown away mindlessly every day.

Due to the bike lock and some glass bottles the weight was rather high today. the bucket is around 500gr so 2kg is what I have in trash (... next time I could just use the Tara button).
