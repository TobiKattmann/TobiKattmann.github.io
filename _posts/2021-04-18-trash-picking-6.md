0900-1000, ~1.5kg of weight

Yet again, another day with the best intention to stand up at 7:30 ... well 9:00 it is. Today, I also did not really made my trash-pick area bigger, and i wonder how big the area could be, if one were to pick trash once a week for one hour. Maybe I already hit that area, we will see. 

Lidl (supermarket) is giving away football stickers, which were meant for the World Cup 2020, for free with each purchase. Obviously these stickers can be seen in the bushes right after. Reinhold Ranftl is not exactly a superstar and I don't expect to find a Neymar on the ground anytime soon.

The local geese have kids and it seems to be breakfast time. They look like tiny T-Rex with a lot more fluff (although the science suspects that dinosaurs had fluffy feathers, [source](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/160405-dinosaurs-feathers-birds-museum-new-york-science)). But despite the resemblance they are a lot less frightening.

Nice parking in front of the bicyle rack of the metro. Great way to say `fuck you`.

A wet towel is of course a nice weight boost for my trash-picking. Thanks random citizen.

There is quite a bit of trash in this slope down to the metro tracks. I will have to wait for a moment with no traffic because of a construction side or so.

I noticed a lot of trash of `Kinder` products. They are of course heavily advertised to kids each portion is nicely wrapped in plastic. We all know the one-bite-sized `Schokobon`. It is tough to blame the kids when it is not sure if they even are the cause ... might as well be grown-ups. But this concept of tiny things to eat wrapped in plastic in a bigger plastic bag should not exist as it heavily favors littering.
