# Honey Garlic

For some reason I watched [a video on how to make fermented garlic honey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLVxVQ8O0s4) and due to its striking simplicity I decided to give it a try. Btw the `Its Alive` show of `Bon Appetit` with its presenter Brad Leone is really entertaining: I do recommend.

The recipe is as simple as it gets: peel garlic, give it light crush and put it in a container. Add honey such that the garlic is covered and leave it in a room temperature environment. Release the pressure from the jar every day or when necessary and make sure the floating garlic is covered slightly by honey by flipping the glass or shaking (when the honey is more liquid later) each day. Thats all. And it is meant to be good for a couple of months in the cabinet.

The honey is from a local organic supermarket `naturgut` and the garlic from 2 places. In the wider glass from `naturgut` which was a bit more dry and smaller cloves compared to the other one which were from `Kaufland`.

One can add spices to the mix, but for a first try I went without. See [here](https://youtu.be/F18w7YoV1jE?t=512) for a look on added chili.

I used of course the best honey and garlic I could get and put everything together in a cleaned jar (former tomate sauce or sth like that). The honey was very viscous at this stage, so I think I took a bit too much at this stage. As mentioned in the initial video one warm up the honey in a hot water bath to make it more fluid.

After 1 day the fermation went off like crazy which the bubbles indicate. I `burped` i.e. opened the lid to release the pressure, a couple of times in the first days.
The smell of these burps is wild as one might imagine 
The taller glass seemed to have a lid with better air-tight closure? Because in later stages the wider glass was smeared in honey.
My guess is that honey was in the gap between lid and glass after turning it upside down and then the building pressure pushed these bit out into the wild. 
The wider glass also had less garlic in it so

After 4 days the top honey already gets more fluid and clearer which makes covering the garlic with honey by shaking much easier. On the shelf the dripped out honey is visible so I do recommend putting some towel or so below like in later pictures. The fermentation bubbles are still there.

After 6 days it shows that the taller glass with the `Kaufland` garlic developed that fluid honey much faster. The gloves were bigger and jucier and together with less honey that probably was to be expected.

Eight days into the process the fermentation bubbles are a lot less and the honey turned really liquid with a amber color which looks qiute cool in my opinion.

The wider class catched up in the process after 20 days.

I did not taste the honey (or garlic for that matter) in any stage in the process which i will have to do next time.
