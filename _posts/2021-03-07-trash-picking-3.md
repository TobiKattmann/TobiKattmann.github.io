0900-1015, ~1.2kg of weight

I put the alarm on 8am to go trash picking but after hitting the snooze button a couple of times I was off at 9am to pick some juicy trash. The temperature read -2C so I put on a hat and some warmer clothes. 
First task of the day was to repick previously cleaned where quite a bit accumulated over to 1 week since last time. Cigbutts seem to accumulate the fastest ... or I overlooked them the most in previous sweeps. Did I already mention that those butts are super frustrating as in some areas you can stand in literally one single spot  and pick 10min of those around you. I did exactly that in front of a bench close to the Probstsee. 
Again the weight is probably boosted a lot by a bicycle lock. 
A couple of local geese showed up and I thought whether animals sometimes mistaken cigbutts for food? Because even if they were biodegradebale in a reasonable timeframe, that wouldn't justify throwing them everywhere. Especially directly next to fricking trash can.
But all in all a rather calm sunday morning with only very few people around which I prefer because often they look at you. Listening through the `Das Podcast Ufo` which is always nice.
I neglected some areas here and there because picking stuff only next to the tram rails and a large road is a bit unrewarding.
Oh and I started using a plastic bucket to put plastic bag in to go pick a lot of plastic :) but that is really a lot better with the wide opening. Do recommend.
