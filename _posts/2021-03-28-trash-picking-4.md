1000-1130, ~1.0kg of weight

Yet again another sunday where I wanted to get up early to pick some trash and ended up at 10. Anyway. I wanted to start taking trash out of a corner which I noticed a day earlier. Turns out the gap between a bench and pillar was used as a trash can for cigarettes. What the fuck. Like 5 empty cigarette packs and ~50 cigarettes. Maybe that accumulated over 8 years this building exists though. Altogether I think toady every second pick was a cigarette bud and that is frustrating.

I found a Lego piece.

I guess for most trash it is tough to identify the litter-er. DNA samples from cigarette buds is not really in my budget and is questionable in terms of private data. But in this case I think I have a pretty clear suspect.

On the positive side: I found 1 cent today. I would love to send invoices to the city for cleaning but until then I get paid by the streets

I think this is the metal slider of a floppy disk and I looks pretty new as well. Couple of years ago my brother dug out an old computer of ours to get some Diablo 2 savegames off a floppy disk out of nostalgia.

I guess it is fairtrade so you can trow the label in the environment such that your karma is perfectly balanced (, as all things should be - Thanos).

Wrapping up: 90 min and pretty exact 1kg of trash in the exact same area as always while listening to `Fest und Flauschig`.
