Today was the first sunny and warm day of the year. T-Shirt and shorts. So I grabbed the NifthyNabber and a plastic bag (and a `can-do`-attitude) and picked some trash directly around my flat. The start was at 11am in the morning and the plan was to maybe do an hour or so... I stopped 3 hours later at 2pm with a full trash bag.

That bag weighted in at 3.5 kg. The weight comes primarily from glass bottles, especially one empty 0.7l Jaegermeister, a small bottle of sparkling wine and a couple a `Klopfers`. In two occasions I picked up the glass shards of complete bottles. Imo that is a bit more on the unfunny side of things as animals and kids/adults can hurt themselves there. The majority of trash picked, which accounts for the most time, were cigarette buds (seriously fuck smokers who just throw their buds on the ground and I guess that is the majority). I didn't count but I would estimate ~50-100. Another high picking count were small plastic pieces like the torn edge of granola bar, or a Kinder-Schokobong wrapper. As there is a dog-poo-bag-dispenser nearby I picked up a lot of unused of those bags and at least one with dog-poo in it. When going over the grass-pieces it was also important to avoid those land-mines. A neighbor (who I know) stopped by and we chatted a bit about trash in the environemt and he even asked whether he could borrow that trash picker one day!

I got a blister (Blase) on my right inner thumb from the picking. Halfway I also had a bit of a sore grab muscle in that right hand but changing the grip position, which is very much possible on the marvolous NiftyNabber, helped that.

Sending an invoice to the GWG (owner of the housing complex) or the city of Stuttgart would be a cool thing to do. 3hours x Minimum wage 9.35 Euro = 28.05 Euro. This is more about making aware of the problem, rather then wanting the actual money.

The pick area was fairly small and mostly the area around the kindergarden playground. Todo make a hatching on the image of the picked area and compute the square meter picked.
